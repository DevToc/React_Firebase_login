We GODHAN are the first classified platform which facilitates community renting solution which enables people to rent their unused items to other people which just need the item for a specific job.  The idea behind this platform was that most of the time people buy things which they use only once/twice and then it’s stored without any use. It makes money to one person while it saves money to other.

People are generally shy of asking things from neighbor and friends and spend money. The cost of hiring from professional shop is high as well.
